# theros

A simple and reliable tool to deploy static websites.

## What is theros?

Theros is a CLI tool to deploy static websites. It takes a website and upload it to an s3 bucket.

You can use Theros to quickly create a new s3 bucket with the proper static website hosting configuration with a single command.

## Why

We need an alternative to manually uploading static websites to s3 buckets and repeatidly configuring its hosting policies. 
Some of the tools I found around to do so, was either not mantained anymore or not fast/simple enought.
